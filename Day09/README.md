## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you will be able to:

* Create reusable classes and objects.
* Use constructors for object initialization.
* Apply static members appropriately.
* Control class members using access modifiers.
* Implement inheritance using `extends`.
* Apply runtime polymorphism through method overriding.
* Use abstract classes to define common behavior.
* Create contracts using interfaces.
* Differentiate interfaces and abstract classes.
* Apply OOP principles to Playwright Page Object Model design.

## 🏗️ Playwright Framework Perspective

```text
BasePage
    │
    ├── Common Methods
    │
    ▼
LoginPage
    │
    ├── Login Actions
    │
    ▼
HomePage
    │
    ├── Navigation Actions
    │

Test Cases
```

OOP concepts help build:

* Reusable Page Objects
* Base Classes
* Common Utilities
* Framework Abstractions
* Maintainable Automation Components

## 📚 Key Concepts

| Concept           | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Class             | Blueprint for objects            |
| Object            | Instance of a class              |
| Constructor       | Initializes objects              |
| Static            | Class-level members              |
| Access Modifiers  | Control member visibility        |
| Inheritance       | Reuse parent functionality       |
| Polymorphism      | Different runtime behavior       |
| Abstraction       | Hide implementation details      |
| Interface         | Define a contract                |
| Abstract Class    | Contract + common implementation |
| Method Overriding | Redefine inherited behavior      |

## 🔑 Important Keywords

| Keyword      | Usage                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `extends`    | Class inheritance                     |
| `implements` | Class implementing an interface       |
| `super()`    | Invoke parent constructor             |
| `static`     | Define class-level members            |
| `abstract`   | Define abstract classes/methods       |
| `override`   | Explicitly override inherited methods |

---

## 📚 Best Practices

* Use `private` for implementation details that should remain internal.
* Use `protected` for functionality shared with child classes.
* Use `extends` when genuine inheritance relationships exist.
* Prefer composition when inheritance does not represent a clear relationship.
* Use `override` when redefining inherited methods.
* Keep Page Objects focused on page-specific behavior.
* Use interfaces and abstract classes to establish clear framework contracts.
